Text Editor- A piece of software that allows you to download and install on your computer, write and manage text, and access online through web browser.
  Features to keep an eye out for: Code completion, syntax highlighting, variety of themes(that are easy to see and read), and ability to choose from a healthy selection of extensions available when you need them.
    Code completion- allows you to start typing and then it displays possible suggestions based on what you typed. (kind of like "T9" or text prediction)

     Syntax Highlighting- takes the text you typed and makes it more noticeable by adding colors.
     Themes- allow you to change the color of the background of you text editor, series of colors in your text, and at times other parts of your software.
