# File Manipulation

## Making a Directory
Linux organises it's file system in a hierarchical way
  - mkdir - make directory - creates directory

### Removing a Directory
  - rmdir - remove directory 
    * Two things to note. 1. rmdir supports the -v and -p options similar to mkdir. 2. a directory must be empty before it may be removed 

#### Creating a Blank File
  - touch - creates blank files - use to modify the access and modification times on a file

#### Copying a File or Directory
   - cp - copy - duplicate files or directory 

#### Moving a File or Directory
   - mv - move - similar to cp but can move directories without having to provide the -r option.
