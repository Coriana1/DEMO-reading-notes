# Basic Navigation

## Moving around the system
* pwd - print working directory - tells you what your current or present working directory is.
      -  Use of this command to remind yourself where you presently are

* ls - list - will tell you you CURRENT LOCATION within a file/directory 

* path - to get to a particular file or directory on the system 
      - two types: absolute: specify a location (file/directory) in relation to the root directory & always begin with a forward slash
                  relative:  specifies the location of a file or directory relative to the current working directory.
                        - ~ (tilde) - shortcut for your home directory
                        - . (dot) - reference to your current directory
                        - .. (dotdot)- reference to the parent directory
* cd - change directory - move around in the system to another directory.
