## My reading notes journal for Code 102

Greetings!

My name is Coriana Williams. I am a Navy Veteran with a background in Human Resource and Information Technology. In my spare time I write poetry and also do spoken words for any Open Mic that I can find. I've alway been drawn to coding and what all goes into creating platforms that we've grown to use and love, which lead me to applying to Code Fellows. I'm ready to be the mind behind the *magic*!

**Growth Mindset**: Your professional and everyday mindset have to go hand and hand when it comes down to being self motivated. You have to wake up and believe that anxiety DOES NOT and CAN NOT conquer you. Having a Growth Mindset means remembering you are human, you will have "no's" but a yes is destine to follow. You just have to run a little futher, and be consistent and patient with yourself. A Growth Mindset is telling complacency to "GET OUT" and inviting potential, purpose, process and promise in! 
   
   **REMEMBER**:
