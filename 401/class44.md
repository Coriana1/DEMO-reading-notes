## Ethics in the workplace
1. "The Developer's Dilemma" by Bryan Cantrill

This article brings attention to the ethical challenges faced by developers when they are asked to create code that is deceitful or unethical. The author's personal experience of building a website that promoted a specific drug under false pretenses serves as a cautionary tale about the potential harm that can arise from such practices. The article emphasizes the responsibility of developers to consider the consequences of their code and highlights the importance of integrating ethics into their work.

I completely agree with the article's stance on the significance of ethics in technology. Developers have a duty to ensure that their work aligns with moral principles and prioritizes the well-being of users. It is not enough to merely follow legal requirements; ethical considerations must be at the forefront of software development. The author's story serves as a powerful reminder of the impact technology can have on individuals and society, underscoring the need for developers to be mindful of the potential consequences of their actions. Ultimately, ethical coding practices are essential to build a technology-driven world that is safe, trustworthy, and beneficial for everyone.

2. "Microsoft Employees Protest Work With ICE, as Tech Industry Mobilizes Over Immigration" by Kate Conger

This article sheds light on the protest by Microsoft employees regarding the company's collaboration with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). It highlights the employees' concerns about the ethical implications of assisting an agency involved in the separation of migrant families. The employees argue for prioritizing ethics and human well-being over financial gains, urging the company to sever its ties with ICE. The article also underscores the broader trend of tech workers becoming increasingly active in advocating for ethical behavior within their companies, citing similar actions by employees at Google, Apple, and Facebook. Personally, I support the employees' protest as it showcases the importance of ethical considerations in the tech industry. It is encouraging to see employees taking a stand and demanding accountability from their employers, emphasizing the need for technology companies to align their actions with moral values and societal well-being.

## Ethics in Technology
1. "Will Democracy Survive Big Data and Artificial Intelligence?"

This article addresses the ethical dilemmas surrounding self-driving cars, particularly in situations where accidents are unavoidable. It raises questions about whom the vehicle should prioritize in such instances, highlighting the need to program ethical decision-making into autonomous systems. The article discusses the tension between utilitarian approaches that prioritize minimizing overall harm and the natural inclination of individuals to prioritize their own safety. It also explores the double standard applied to machines, which are expected to make morally correct decisions without the human frailties associated with split-second choices. Personally, I find this article compelling as it delves into the complex ethical considerations of self-driving cars and underscores the importance of developing guidelines and regulations to ensure responsible and ethical behavior in this emerging technology. The collision between moral choices, technological capabilities, and societal expectations is a thought-provoking topic that warrants further exploration.

2. "The ethical dilemmas of self-driving cars"

The article on the ethical dilemmas of self-driving cars sheds light on the challenging questions surrounding the prioritization of lives in unavoidable accidents and the responsibility of programming ethical decisions into autonomous vehicles. It highlights the double standard in how people perceive human drivers versus machines, as humans are given leeway for split-second moral choices while machines are expected to make ethically correct decisions in advance. The need for guidelines and regulations to address these dilemmas is emphasized, with a recognition that individuals tend to prioritize their own safety when directly affected. Personally, I find this article thought-provoking as it underscores the importance of careful deliberation and decision-making in programming autonomous vehicles, and the profound societal implications of the ethical choices made in this technology. Striking a balance between human safety and considering the broader impact is crucial for the future of transportation.
