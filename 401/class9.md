# Discuss 2 possible project ideas that could be completed by you and a partner in the alloted time.

1. Develop a Content Management System (CMS) for a blogging platform that allows users to create, manage, and publish blog posts. The CMS should provide full RESTful CRUD operations for blog posts, user authentication, and access control.
2. Create an e-commerce platform with user authentication that allows customers to browse and purchase products. The platform should include features such as product listing, shopping cart management, order processing, and user authentication with role-based access control.
