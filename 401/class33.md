# What is Role Based Access Control (RBAC)?
1. What is Role Based Access Control (RBAC)?
  - A security model that provides a structured approach to managing access to resources within a system. It defines roles based on the responsibilities and permissions required by different users or groups of users.
2. Share some an example of RBAC including all possible CRUD operations and correlating roles.
  - For example of an online content management system. We can define three roles: "Admin," "Editor," and "Viewer." Each role will have different permissions and access levels for CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on content.
    * Admin: The admin role has full control and can perform all CRUD operations. They can create, read, update, and delete content.
    * Editor: The editor role has permissions to create, read, and update content but does not have the ability to delete content.
    * Viewer: The viewer role only has permission to read content but cannot create, update, or delete it.
In this example, the RBAC model ensures that only users with the appropriate roles can perform specific actions. It helps maintain security and restricts unauthorized access to critical operations or sensitive data.
3. What are the Benefits of RBAC?
  - Enhanced Security, Simplified Administration, Scalability and Flexibility, Compliance and Auditing
