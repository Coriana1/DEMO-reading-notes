# Engineering Readings

1. What’s the one thing I bring to this career (and a potential employer) that nobody else can?
  - I bring passion, enthusiasm, and new ideas that create an environments that thrives on innovation and continuous improvement. Since being in the military service pushing boundaries, think creatively, and embrace change has been second nature for me and creates a unique combination of qualities sets you apart and allows you to make a significant impact in any career field and for potential employers.


2. What are 3 things I’ll start doing to “un-stick” myself whenever I get stuck on tough piece of code, logic, or feature?
  - Asking the questions that I have at that 15 min mark rather than waiting, not getting stuck in a loop on google from not reading the material and take my time to actual read the articles, and asking the instructor more detailed questions before class ends as I have them.
