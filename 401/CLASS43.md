# getting started with react native
1. Name three Core Components of React Native and describe what they do.
- View: View is the fundamental building block of a React Native app's user interface. It is similar to <div> in HTML and represents a container that supports styling and layout options.
Text: Text component is used for displaying text in a React Native app. It supports basic text formatting and styling.
Image: Image component is used for displaying images in a React Native app. It supports various image sources and resizing options.
2. What problem does React Native solve (why call it native)?
  - The problem of developing mobile applications using JavaScript and React, while still achieving a native-like user experience. It achieves this by allowing developers to write code in JavaScript and utilize React's component-based architecture. React Native then translates this code into native platform-specific components, enabling the app to run directly on the device's operating system.
3. What are the building blocks of a React Native app? How does that compare to a React app?
  - Components, Props, State, Styling

## expo
1. What solution does expo provide?
  -  A set of tools and services for building React Native applications more easily. 
2. Expo tries to manage as much of the complexity of building apps as possible, which is why we call it the ____ workflow.
  - Managed
3. What is the difference between React Native and Expo?
  - Expo is a framework built on top of React Native.

### expo snack
1. Checkout this tool. What does snack allow you to do?

### ejecting
1. What does “eject” mean within the context of Expo?
  - An online tool provided by Expo that allows you to write and preview React Native code directly in the browser. It provides a convenient way to experiment, prototype, and share React Native apps without needing to set up a local development environment.
2. When should you not eject?
  - If you want to continue using the features and services provided by Expo's managed workflow without the need to manage the native projects manually. 
3. Why might you choose to eject?
  - When you need to access certain native capabilities, libraries, or modify the native code directly.
### Additional Questions
1. Looking ahead at this module’s course schedule, What do you look forward to learning?
  - Architecture
2. What are your learning goals after reading and reviewing the class README?
  - Understanding the React Native Development Workflow: I aim to gain a clear understanding of how React Native facilitates the development of native mobile applications. I want to grasp the concepts of components, props, state, and styling in React Native and learn how to create a mobile application using these principles.
