# Web Sockets
1. What is a Web Socket?
  -
2. Describe the Web Socket request/response handshake and what happens once the connection is established.
  -
3. Web Sockets provide a standardized way for the server to send content to a client without first receiving a ____ from that client.

## Socket.io vs Web Sockets
1. What is the difference between WebSocket and Socket.IO? (think Git and GitHub, or OAuth and Auth0).
  - WebSocket is like the underlying technology or protocol, while Socket.IO is a higher-level library that makes it easier to use WebSocket and adds extra features on top of it.
2. When would you use Socket.IO?
  -when you need real-time communication or bidirectional data transfer between a client (such as a web browser) and a server
3. When would you use WebSockets?
  -when you need a persistent, full-duplex communication channel between a client and a server. 

## OSI Model Explained
1. What are a couple of key takeaways from this video?
  - WebSockets can be utilized in various applications such as real-time stock market updates, live sports scores, instant messaging, real-time tracking systems, or collaborative document editing. Whenever there is a need for efficient, bidirectional communication between the client and server, WebSockets provide a reliable and performant solution.

## TCP Handshakes Explained
1. Translate the gist of this video to a non-technical friend
  -Here's how the TCP handshake would translate to our phone conversation:

You: "Hey, I want to talk to you!"
Friend: "Great! I'm here and ready to listen."
You: "Let's make sure we can hear each other clearly. Can you hear me?"
Friend: "Yes, I can hear you loud and clear. Can you hear me?"
You: "Perfect! Now we can start our conversation!"

Just like in our phone conversation, the TCP handshake allows computers to establish a clear line of communication before they start exchanging information, making sure everything goes smoothly.
