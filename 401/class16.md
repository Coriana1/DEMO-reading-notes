# AWS EC2
1. What is an EC2 Instance?
  - Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) and allows users to rent virtual machines (VMs) on which they can run their applications or host their websites. 
2. Name 2 use cases for EC2.
  - Hosting websites or web applications, running data processing or computational workloads
2. Provide 1 reason to use ECS instead of a service such as Heroku, Digital Ocean, or Render.com.
  - The flexibility and control it offers. 

## EC2 For Humans
1. Where can we find EC2 on the AWS Console?
  - Logging into the AWS Management Console and searching for "EC2" in the service search bar.
2. Explain the general difference between T2 Micro and XL.
  - T2 Micro instances have a smaller amount of CPU and memory resources compared to XL instances. 
3. Explain a “Compute Cycle” to a non-technical friend.
  - Just like humans perform various tasks, a compute cycle refers to the execution of a specific task or set of instructions by a computer or server. It's like a step-by-step process that the computer goes through to perform a specific computation, such as processing data, running calculations, or executing software instructions. Each compute cycle represents a unit of work performed by the computer, similar to how a person completes a task or a series of actions to achieve a desired outcome.

## Elastic Beanstalk
1. What is Elastic Beanstalk?
  - Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) offering by AWS that simplifies the deployment and management of applications.
2. Describe the relationship between EC2 and Elastic Beanstalk.
  - Elastic Beanstalk leverages EC2 instances to run the deployed applications. Elastic Beanstalk provisions and manages the EC2 instances, load balancers, and other required resources behind the scenes. It automates many tasks involved in application deployment and environment management, making it easier for developers to focus on their application code rather than infrastructure setup.
3. Name some benefits of using Elastic Beanstalk.
  - Easy application deployment, auto-scaling and load balancing
