# An introduction to NodeJS and Express
1. Explain middleware, answer as though I were a non-technical recruiter.
  - Middleware functions are like filters or plugins that intercept requests and responses as they pass through the application. 
2. Express the most popular __ __ ____.
  - Node web framework
3. Express is “unopinionated.” What does that mean?
  -  Meaning Express does not enforce any particular way of structuring or organizing an application. Allows developers to have more freedom and control over their code and the architecture of their web applications.
4. What is a module and why is modularity useful to us as developers?
  - *Module* - a self-contained unit of code that encapsulates related functionality and can be easily reused in different parts of an application or in different projects. It can include functions, variables, classes, or other components.
  - *Modularity* useful because it promotes code organization and separation of concerns, encourages code reuse and promotes DRY (dont repeat yourself), and supports collabortive development by enabling multiple developers to work different modules of an app simultaneously.

## What is NPM?
1. What version of npm are you running on your machine?
  - 9.6.4
2. What command would you type to install a library/package called ‘jshint’ into your node project?
  - npm install jshint

## What is TDD?
1. Explain why tests are important. Please explain as though I were your non technical elder.
  - They help ensure that software applications are reliable, function correctly, and are secure. 
2. What are three expected benefits of testing?
  -  Improved software quality, enhanced reliability and stability, and cost and time savings
3. Name at lest 2 individual pitfalls and at least 2 team pitfalls commonly encountered while writing tests.
  - **Individual pitfalls** lack of proper test planning, over reliance on automated testing
    **team pirfalls** inconsistent testing, lack of collaboration 

## CI/CD
1. What are three benefits of Continuous Integration?
  - Faster feedback loop, Increased Collaboration and Team Efficiency, Early Bug Detection
2. What is the difference between Continuos Delivery and Continuous Deployment?
  - Continuous Delivery focuses on preparing code changes for production and gives the development team the flexibility to decide when to deploy, while Continuous Deployment automates the entire deployment process and releases changes to production automatically without human intervention.
3. Explain how GitHub fits into this process assuming the listener comes from a non-technical background
  - An online platform that allows developers to store and manage their code repositories in a centralized location. It's a collaboration hub for software development teams, allowing them to work together on code, track changes, and manage different versions of their codebase.

### Reflection
1. What are your learning goals after reading and reviewing the class README?
  - As long as we have been practing and working with code I am still not confident in my reading abilities after the work is done. My goal is to be patient but persisent with myself while doing self code review for at minimum 15 mins following completion of labs so I can get comfortable with talking my code out. I also want to start using more terminolgy that translates to whar being a developer is rather than shorthanding everything out of fear of using the worg terms. With this I will be holding myself accountable for finding the right answers or way to word things by listen to the TAs and Ryans delivery and doing my own studies.
