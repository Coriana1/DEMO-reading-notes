# Gatsby and next.js Resources
1. Teach us two things about Next.js.
  - Next.js provides a page-based routing system: Next.js offers an intuitive page-based routing system that allows you to create different pages for your application. It supports both static generation (SSG) and server-side rendering (SSR) on a per-page basis. This means you can pre-render pages for performance and SEO or choose to render them on the server dynamically. Next.js handles the routing for you, making it easier to navigate between different pages in your React application.

  * Next.js offers built-in features and optimizations: Next.js includes various built-in features and optimizations to enhance developer experience and improve performance. It automatically performs code splitting, which helps to load pages faster by splitting the code into smaller chunks. Next.js also supports client-side routing with optimized prefetching, allowing for smoother navigation within your application. Additionally, it provides built-in CSS and Sass support, making it easy to style your components. With Next.js, you can leverage these features without the need for additional configurations or setups.

Overall, Next.js simplifies the development process and provides a robust framework for building React applications. It offers a seamless developer experience while handling essential tasks like routing, rendering, code splitting, and CSS support, allowing you to focus on building your application's functionality.
2. Teach us two things about Gatsby.js.
  - Static Site Generator: Gatsby.js is a static site generator built with React. It takes your content, whether it's Markdown files, data from APIs, or any other source, and generates a static website that can be deployed to a web server or a content delivery network (CDN). The static nature of Gatsby sites makes them fast, secure, and highly optimized for performance.

  * Rich Ecosystem and Plugin System: Gatsby.js has a vibrant ecosystem with a wide range of plugins and themes that extend its functionality. Plugins allow you to add features like image optimization, SEO optimization, content management systems (CMS) integration, and more to your Gatsby site with just a few lines of configuration. The plugin system makes it easy to customize and extend your site's functionality without having to write complex code from scratch.

These are just two aspects of Gatsby.js, but there's much more to explore, such as its support for GraphQL, serverless functions, and progressive web app (PWA) features. Gatsby.js is a powerful tool for building modern, performant websites and web applications.
