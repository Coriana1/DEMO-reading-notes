  - During my military serice I was apart of a junior Sailor organization that was putting together a field day type event for the higher up leadership. Being apart of this organization gave you not only recognition but trust with more resposibilities with day to day operations. This was important for promotability reasons, so the Sailors that volunteered to help were serious about the meeting. Although everyone wanted the event to be successful we fostered a lighthearted enviroment with the realization that we were not enemies but teammates. Everyone agreed to meet after long workdays but some would bear small snacks or coffee as gifts, the tones were encouraging, and this made it easy to share ideas. Even when someone was passionate about an idea and it was shutdown it wasn't taken personally becasue there was supportive words of how powerful the idea may have been but the timing wouldn't accomadate. At the end of it all no was worried about being the master mind or spokes person behind the concept because it was mutal agreements and we all shared the vision and recognition. 
3. What impact do teams that operate with a high degree of psychological safety have on their company and the team members?
  - It is vital to the performance and morale of the team as a whole. Leaders who take the time to look inward to understand their own emotions, anxieties, and stressors then they can better support their team. Their peers would then feel more comfortable speaking up without fear of shame or retaliation.
