My highest area was effective courage and lowest being bias and identity. I'm not surprised that effective courage scored so high because I pride myself in being able to speak up for how I am emotionally and mentally affected but situations. Bias and identity ranked lowest because my experiences have not made me form any detrimental opinions about other people in the workplace. Everyone gets a clean slate. I plan to take this feedback and moving into this upcoming 301 course practicing building meaningful connections and exercising effective courage.
