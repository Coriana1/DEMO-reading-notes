My highest area was effective courage and lowest being bias and identity. I'm not surprised that effective courage scored so high because I pride myself in being able to speak up for how I am emotionally and mentally affected but situations. Bias and identity ranked lowest because my experiences have not made me form any detrimental opinions about other people in the workplace. Everyone gets a clean slate. I plan to take this feedback and moving into this upcoming 301 course practicing building meaningful connections and exercising effective courage. 


I assumed I would score highest in self awareness and social awareness and I did. I've worked pretty hard to be present in what I'm doing, why I'm doing it and how it needs to be done for personal success. I know what is needed to be done when I'm stuck and if I am stuck too long I seek whatever help I can get and past anxieties have made me very self aware of everything in general.
