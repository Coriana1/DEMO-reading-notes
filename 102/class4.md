## Creating Hyperlinks

1. To create a basic link, we wrap text or other content inside what element? *Attribute*
2. The href attribute contains what information? 
    *For <a> and <area> elements, specifies the URL of the page the link goes to.*
    *For <base> elements, the href attribute specifies the base URL for all relative URLs on a page.*
    *For <link> elements, the href attribute specifies the location (URL) of the external resource.*
3. What are some ways we can ensure links on our pages are accessible to all readers?
    *DO NOT link urls.*
    *DO NOT use the words Click Here, Read More, Find It, Buy Now, or any other "common" phrase for link text.*
    *DO NOT link to two different urls using the same words on the same page.*
    *DO NOT link to the same url using different words on the same page.*

## CSS Layout
## CSS Layout: Normal Flow CSS Layout: Positioning

4. What is meant by “normal flow”? The way that Block and Inline elements are displayed on a page before any changes are made to their layout.
5. What are a few differences between block-level and inline elements? Block elements always start from a new line. Inline elements never start from a new line.

8. Describe the difference between a function declaration and a function invocation.
