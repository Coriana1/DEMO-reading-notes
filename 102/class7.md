## Programming with JavaScript

Control Flow - Order which the computer executes statements in script
Conditional structure - (if...else...ect) - different code executes depending on whether form is complete or not
    *Tyically scripts include: conditionals, loops & functions

JavaScript Functions - Block of code designed to perform a particular task and executes when "something" invokes it (calls)
    - Defined by the function keyword, follow by a name, followed by ().
        * Can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar sign
        * () include parameter names separated by commas -> ex (coriana1, coriana2)
        * Code executed, by function, placed inside {}
        * Function parameters listed inside (), & arguements are values recieved by function when it invoked
Function Invocation - Code inside the function will execute when "something" invokes "calls" the function
    - When event occurs (user clicks a button) 
    - When it's invoked (called) from JavaScript code
    - Automatically (self invoked)
Function return - If function was invoked from a statement JavaScript will "returns" to executed code after the invoking statements

# Types of JavaScript Operators
    1) aritmetic 2) Assignment 3) Comparison 4) Logical 5) Conditional 

**JavaScript Comparison Operators**
==      equal to
===     equal value & equal type
!=      not equal
!==     not equal value nor type
>       greater than
<       less than
>=      greater than or equal to
<=      less than or equal to
?       ternary operator

**Functions 
    .document.write()
    prompt()
    .console.log()
