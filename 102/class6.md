    3) Using const.
    4) Using nothing

* Variables - Containers for storing data
    EX: x, y, z -> declare JavaScript variables with var, let, or const.

* ALL JavaScript variables must be identified with identifiers 
    Identifiers - Short names (ex: x, y) or descriptive names (ex: age, sum, total, value)

* Constructing name rules:
    1) Names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar sign
    2) Must begin with letter, (.), ($), ($), (_)
    3) Case sensitive (y and Y have different meanings)
    4) Reserved words (JavaScript keywords) can't be names

* Conditional logic:
if (this is true){do this thing}
    else{ do that thing}
if(userName == "Cori"){
    console.log("Hey Cori);
