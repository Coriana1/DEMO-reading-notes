# JavaScript Object Basics

1. How would you describe an object to a non-technical friend you grew up with?
    -  A collection of related data and/or functionality.
2. What are some advantages to creating object literals?
    - convenience, flexibility in declaration, and less code during declaration.
3. How do objects differ from arrays? Objects represent “things” with characteristics **(properties)** and arrays create and store lists of data in a single variable.
4. Give an example for when you would need to use bracket notation to access an object’s property instead of dot notation.
    - When we are accessing an object's property using a variable or when the property's key is a number or includes a symbol or is two words with a space.
5. Evaluate the code below. What does the term **this** refer to and what is the advantage to using this?
    - **"This”** refers to an object that is executing the current piece of code. It references the object that is executing the current function. The advantage is not having to using "this" is it can be applied to any object.

## Introduction To The DOM

6. What is the DOM?
    - **"The W3C Document Object Model (DOM)** is a platform and language-neutral interface that allows programs and scripts to dynamically access and update the content, structure, and style of a document.
7. Briefly describe the relationship between the DOM and JavaScript.
    - JavaScript allows you to manipulate the DOM that controls the client side scripting.
