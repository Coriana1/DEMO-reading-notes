## 6 Reasons for Pair Programming
1. What are the 6 reasons for pair programming?

    Knowledge sharing
    Team communication
    Increases team productivity
    Encourages collaboration
    Helps with onboarding new team members

3. How does pair programming work?
  - We are given pairs and a tack, once in the pair we decide on tasks (equally), explain the roles (who will start off narrorating and who will text) for each person and deadlines, create the code, then swicth roles so the other person can take over and type of code as we talk through it together, test whatever we come up with, and refactor whatever is broken or can be added onto.
